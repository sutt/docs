{% hint style="info" %}
Before you can cash out your crypto, you may need to sell it to your Coinbase cash balance before transferring the cash to your bank. You can then either transfer ("cash out") the funds to your bank or leave them in your cash balance for future crypto purchases. There's no limit on the amount of crypto you can sell for cash.

### **3a. Sell crypto to your Coinbase cash balance**

#### **To sell your crypto:**

1. Sign in to your Coinbase account, on the web or mobile app
2. Select **Buy & Sell**
3. Select **Sell**
4.  Select the crypto you want to sell and the amount.

    _<mark style="color:yellow;">If on mobile, you'll be required to crypto the asset you want to sell before entering an amount</mark>_
5. Change the **To** destination, if applicable.
   * This will likely default to your local currency balance (USD) but you may have the option of adding to another balance (e.g., USDC).
6. Select **Review order.**

Once the crypto sell order is complete, the funds will be available in your cash balance to buy other assets or cash out to your bank.
