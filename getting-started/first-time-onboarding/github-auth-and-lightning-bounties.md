### Understanding Permissions

When you link your GitHub account to Lightning Bounties, you will be granting us specific permissions:

* **Read-only Access**:
  * We cannot alter anything in your GitHub account.
  * This ensures that your projects and repositories remain untouched.
* **Public-only Access**:
  * We can only access information that is publicly available.
  * Any data that is private or restricted is completely off-limits to us.

### Comparison with Other GitHub Apps/Services

Many GitHub applications request broader permissions than we do. Here's a quick comparison:

### Explanation of Other Platforms:

* **Algora PBC**: Algora PBC requires broader access to your GitHub account, including the ability to verify your identity, know what resources you can access, act on your behalf, and view your email addresses.
* **Replit**: Replit also requires broader permissions, similar to Algora PBC, including the ability to verify your GitHub identity, know what resources you can access, act on your behalf, and view your email addresses.
* **Kodiak**: Kodiak is a GitHub bot that requires access to all repositories, including public repositories (read-only), and has read and write access to checks, code, issues, pull requests, and workflows.

With Lightning Bounties, you maintain greater control over your data and privacy, as we only require read-only, public access.
