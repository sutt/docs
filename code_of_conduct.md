# CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT

## Code of Conduct - Lightning Bounties

***

### Our Pledge: Channeling the Spirit of Satoshi

In the spirit of Satoshi's vision for a decentralized future, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone. Whether you're a Bitcoin maximalist, a Lightning Network enthusiast, or just curious about open-source development, you're welcome here!

We don't discriminate based on age, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, political views, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, orientation, or your preferred alt-coin.

### Our Standards: The Proof-of-Work for Being Awesome

#### Positive Vibes Only (With Low Fees and Fast Confirmation):

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others (even when debating block sizes)
* Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences (yes, even if they prefer a different wallet)
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback (remember, code reviews are not personal attacks)
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing when we mess up (we're all human, even Satoshi probably made typos)
* Focusing on what's best for the community (because that's what open-source is all about)
* Practicing and promoting responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities (because a chain is only as strong as its weakest link )

#### Things That'll Get You Soft-Forked Out:

* Using sexualized language or imagery (save it for your meme coins :coin:)
* Trolling, insulting comments, and personal or political attacks (we're here to build, not to troll :troll:)
* Public or private harassment (not cool on-chain, not cool off-chain :x:)
* Publishing others' private information without permission (respect the cryptography :closed\_lock\_with\_key:)
* Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting (if you wouldn't do it at a Bitcoin meetup, don't do it here :woman\_judge:)

### Our Responsibilities: Nodes of Integrity

Project maintainers are the full nodes of this community. They're responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct.

### Scope: The Lightning Network of Our Community

This Code of Conduct applies to all Lightning Bounties spaces, including our GitHub repository, communication channels, and other official venues. It also applies when you're representing us in public spaces. So if you're wearing a Lightning Bounties t-shirt at a conference, remember: you're our ambassador (no pressure).

### Enforcement: The Consensus Mechanism

If you see something, say something. Report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior to [founders@lightningbounties.com](mailto:founders@lightningbounties.com). We promise to investigate promptly and fairly, and we'll keep your report confidential.

### Enforcement Guidelines: The Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm

1. **Correction**: A gentle reminder that you're human and humans make mistakes.
2. **Warning**: A stern talking-to and a timeout from the community repository.
3. **Temporary Ban**: A vacation from the community. Use this time to read the Bitcoin whitepaper again.
4. **Permanent Ban**: The digital equivalent of a 51% attack against your participation. Permanent and irreversible.

### Conflict Resolution: Achieving Consensus

Before things escalate to the "Enforcement" stage, try these steps:

1. Talk it out directly (use your words, not your hash power)
2. If that fails, ask a community leader for help (they're like the Lightning Network â€“ here to resolve things quickly)
3. If all else fails, initiate the formal reporting process (it's like calling for a hard fork, use it wisely)

### Responsible Disclosure: Don't Break the Chain

As an open-source bug bounty platform, we expect all participants to practice responsible disclosure:

1. Report vulnerabilities through our designated channels (not on Twitter, please)
2. Provide enough info for us to reproduce the issue (we're good, but we can't read the blockchain of your mind)
3. Give us a reasonable time to fix the issue before you go public (even the Lightning Network needed time to develop)
4. Respect user privacy and data (treat others' data like you'd treat your private keys)

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code\_of\_conduct.html.](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code\_of\_conduct.html.)

We've added our own Lightning-fast improvements to make it fit our community better. Remember, in the world of Lightning Bounties, we're all about building a better, more open future.&#x20;



:dart: Happy bug hunting!&#x20;
