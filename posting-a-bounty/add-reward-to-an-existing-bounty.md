# Add Reward to an Existing Bounty

If a bounty already exists for the issue you can add a reward on the detail page.



This also works if you're the original bounty poster and want to add more to the reward, this is a good way to do it.



Note just the same as posting a bounty, you'll also has the chance to set your lock time for this add-on reward to the Bounty under the Advanced Settings. (link lock time page)



Tell your friends when you post a bounty and maybe they'll add funds as well!
