# Issue Lock Time

Bounties come along with a lock time, during which the escrow of the bounty reward is guaranteed.&#x20;



After the lock time is over, you can expire the reward (link to expire how-to page) and return the sats back to your wallet. Maybe try another issue?&#x20;

Note: the reward does NOT automatically become revoked after the lock time is over. That bounty can still be earned. If a reward is unlocked, this simply means that that reward could be expire by the poster .

Lock time helps bounty hunters know the reward will be available by the time they submit their solution. But being able to expire rewards is neccessary because sometimes you solve the issue yourself or your priorities for development change.

We recommend two weeks as a standard lock time, to give your hunters time to get in a PR, but also a short enough time to iterate on your bounty postings and format.
