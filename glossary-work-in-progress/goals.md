# Goals

Lightning Bounties exists to embody the ethos of Bitcoin and the Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) movement. We are building a bug bounty platform that is as free, open, and decentralized as the technologies it supports. Our mission is clear:

* **Empower Global Talent**: Enable anyone, anywhere, to contribute their skills to open-source technology without barriers or restrictions, fostering a meritocratic environment.
* **Onboard Builders to Decentralized Tech**: Bring more people into the Bitcoin, Lightning, Nostr, and open-source ecosystems—technologies essential to freedom and innovation.
* **Educate Developers**: Lower the barrier to entry for contributing to open-source projects by guiding developers from beginner-friendly issues to solving critical challenges.
* **Accelerate Open-Source Innovation**: Drive the rapid development of decentralized technologies by connecting talented contributors with impactful projects and fostering transparent, inclusive collaboration.
* **Showcase Bitcoin’s Utility**: Reward contributors in censorship-resistant, borderless Bitcoin—bypassing centralized intermediaries like banks or payment processors and demonstrating Bitcoin's real-world value.

By aligning with the ethos of Bitcoin and FOSS, Lightning Bounties is more than just a platform—it’s a movement to decentralize opportunity, accelerate innovation, and empower individuals worldwide to build the tools that shape our future.
