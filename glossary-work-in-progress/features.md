# Features

Lightning Bounties is designed to be a frictionless, accessible, and innovative platform for bug bounties. Here are some of the key features that make Lightning Bounties stand out:

### **Minimal Friction, Maximum Accessibility**

* **No Installations Required**: Posting or solving a bounty requires no plugins, no installations on your computer, and no changes to your GitHub account.
* **Effortless Setup**: It takes just 5 clicks and a single copy-paste of a URL to post a bounty—under 30 seconds from start to finish ([see demo video](https://youtu.be/8ZbC5kx6bpM?feature=shared)).
* **No Banking Restrictions**: Operates globally with Bitcoin, bypassing region-restricted payment processors like Stripe.

### **Crowdfunding Bounties**

* **Collaborative Funding**: Multiple users can contribute sats (Bitcoin microtransactions) to fund a single bounty.
* **Support for Third-Party Projects**: Post bounties on issues from popular open-source projects like VSCode, Django, or React—even if you’re not the project owner.

### **Bounty Lock Time & Expiry**

* **Guaranteed Escrow**: Rewards are locked for a set period (e.g., two weeks) to ensure bounty hunters know the reward will be available when they submit their solution.
* **Flexible Expiry Options**: After the lock time ends, you can manually expire the bounty and reclaim your funds if priorities change or the issue is resolved elsewhere.

### **Smart Reward Distribution**

* **GitHub API as an Oracle**: Rewards are automatically sent to contributors once their pull request is successfully merged, preventing fraudulent claims.

Lightning Bounties is built to remove friction, simplify participation, and empower developers to contribute meaningfully to open-source projects while earning Bitcoin.
