# Mission

Lightning Bounties exists to empower a global community of developers and innovators to contribute freely to open-source technology, accelerating the growth of Bitcoin, Lightning, and decentralized ecosystems. By making bug bounties accessible to anyone, anywhere, we lower barriers to entry, onboard new talent to build the tools of tomorrow, and reward contributors with Bitcoinâ€”the currency of freedom. Our mission is to decentralize opportunity and drive innovation that benefits everyone.
